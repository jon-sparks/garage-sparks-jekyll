<p>Expect an unmissable event when Japfest Donington bursts onto Donington Circuit on 1 July 2017!  Japfest Donington will be the ultimate high performance event and is all about pushing the cars to their limits and delivering an adrenaline pumping, heart racing day out. For the fearless among you features include drifting displays and 'take on the track' with our Jap only track times. The action sits alongside the Show & Shine, the large retail village and not to forget the diverse range of Japanese cars on display from both individuals and clubs.</p>
