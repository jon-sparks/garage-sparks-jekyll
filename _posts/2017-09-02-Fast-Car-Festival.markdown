<p>Hot off the heels of our record breaking 2016 event The Fast Car Festival makes a full throttle return to the iconic Donington Park on 2nd July 2017!  

This is the ultimate multi-marque car show capturing the essence of all that is great from the past, present and future of the motoring industry. Expect to see thousands of cars on display in the dedicated paddock zones from Supercars and Hypercars to perfectly restored barn finds, rallycross champions and quarter mile demons to vintage classics and everything in-between. Expect a jam-packed day with non-stop action at the famous Donington track as drivers follow in the footsteps of racing legends, as well as stunts and demos and not forgetting our large retail village! If you are a fan of everything four-wheeled and FAST this is the show for you!</p>
